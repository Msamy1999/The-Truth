# The Straight Path (الصراط المستقيم)

A mobile-first Islamic research and dawah library for readers from all
backgrounds. The site presents sourced articles about Islam, Christianity,
atheism, common claims against Islam, and Palestine in a respectful, clear,
pro-Islam voice.

## Architecture

- Next.js App Router, React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS provide the website.
- Payload CMS is embedded in the Next.js application and uses SQLite in the
  current deployment.
- `lib/content/` is the application-facing content boundary. Pages and shared
  components should not query editorial storage directly.
- Payload owns articles, comparison articles, citations, scripture, glossary,
  source-library records, users, and consented analytics events.
- Navigation, category structure, and research trees remain code-defined under
  `data/` and flow through `lib/content/`.
- `content-drafts/*.json` is reviewed import material for Payload, not a second
  live content source.
- `mobile/` is an Expo application that consumes the same approved content
  contracts and bundles an offline snapshot.

## Local development

Requirements: Node.js 22 and npm.

```powershell
npm ci
npm run dev
```

The site runs at `http://localhost:4173`. Create a local `.env` from
`.env.example` and use a new local `PAYLOAD_SECRET`; never copy the production
environment file into the repository.

## Verification

For ordinary web or content changes run:

```powershell
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
npm run verify:drafts
npm run verify:key-scripture
npm run verify:quran -- .codex-quran-audit/quran-uthmani.json
npm run build
```

The Quran verifier requires a canonical Tanzil Uthmani source file. An optional
second argument can verify the stored English translation against the approved
Saheeh International source.

For a running target:

```powershell
npm run smoke:test -- http://localhost:4173
```

For the Expo application:

```powershell
Set-Location mobile
npm ci
npm run lint
npx expo install --check
```

## Main directories

```text
app/                  Next.js frontend, Payload admin/API, health, TTS, analytics
components/           Shared layout, content, audio, analytics, and UI components
content-drafts/       Reviewed JSON import material for Payload
data/                 Code-defined navigation plus legacy/seed evidence
lib/content/          Application-facing content boundary
payload/              Collections, hooks, imports, and verification tools
mobile/               Expo client and bundled offline content snapshot
scripts/              Smoke, scripture, export, and integrity checks
types/                Shared domain and generated Payload types
```

## Editorial workflow

The admin interface is available at `/admin`. Editorial status and source
status are meaningful controls:

- Article states: Draft, Under review, Published.
- Citation and scripture states: Source pending, Verified.
- The publish hook rejects placeholder markers and unverified linked evidence.
- Do not weaken the publish hook or mark evidence verified merely to pass a
  build.

See [CONTENT-EDITING.md](CONTENT-EDITING.md) for content operations and
[DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md) for the isolated release, backup, health-check,
and rollback procedure.
